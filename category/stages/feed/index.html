<h4 id="the-3-stages-of-game-development">The 3 stages of game development</h4>



<p>Video game development is typically divided into 3 stages:&nbsp;<strong>pre-production, production, and post-production.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h5 id="1-pre-production">1. Pre-production</h5>



<p>This is where every project begins. Essentially, pre-production defines what the game is about, why it should be made, and what it’s going to take to make it.</p>



<p>You might have a great idea for a type of game, a story you want to bring to life, or you may want to build one that leverages a certain type of technology (e.g. VR, a new controller, or console).</p>



<h5 id="2-production">2. Production</h5>



<p>Production is the longest stage of the pipeline, and it’s all hands on deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranging anywhere from 1 to 4 years, production is where the game really starts to take shape. The story is refined, assets (characters, creatures, props and environments) are created, the rules of play are set, levels and worlds are built, code is written, and so much more!</p>



<h5 id="3-post-production">3. Post-production</h5>



<p>Once production is complete and the game has shipped, the game development process continues with some team members being relegated to maintenance (fixing bugs, creating patches) or creating bonus or downloadable content (DLC). Others may move onto the sequel or the next project.</p>



<p>A post-mortem or debrief may be held to discuss what worked/didn’t work and determine what could be done better next time. All the design documents, assets and code are finalized, gathered and stored, in case they are needed in the future.</p>
