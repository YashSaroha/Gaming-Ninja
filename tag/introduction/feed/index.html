										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Making computer games can be a great entry point into computer science. Writing code is a major part of making video games, and 58 percent of the professionals surveyed said that programming was a key element of game development. However, they were quick to point out that the great thrill of programming for game development is to make games enjoyable for others.</p>



<p>This consideration for how others experience games is at the heart of game development, in the form of both imagining another&#8217;s experience of the game and direct feedback by users. It&#8217;s not coding just to code, it is coding to create something fun for others.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Game creation is an art of understanding and bending perception of a user&#8230; Even if it is ultimately used outside the scope of game creation.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;— Game developer</p>



<p><em>&#8220;You need to be creative, open minded to anything that comes at you. You need to think outside of reality. You also need to be determined and focused.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;— 8th grade student</p>



<p>Students indicated that coding was an enjoyable aspect of their course. Oddly, they often didn&#8217;t recognize the games they were creating were made for their classmates to play. This seems to be a key component of a game development course, as reflected by the professionals&#8217; experience in the field. Perhaps highlighting this aspect for students would add to their experience in a positive way.</p>
