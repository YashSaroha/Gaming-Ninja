<h4 id="the-3-stages-of-game-development">The 3 stages of game development</h4>



<p>Video game development is typically divided into 3 stages:&nbsp;<strong>pre-production, production, and post-production.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h5 id="1-pre-production">1. Pre-production</h5>



<p>This is where every project begins. Essentially, pre-production defines what the game is about, why it should be made, and what it’s going to take to make it.</p>



<p>You might have a great idea for a type of game, a story you want to bring to life, or you may want to build one that leverages a certain type of technology (e.g. VR, a new controller, or console).</p>



<h5 id="2-production">2. Production</h5>



<p>Production is the longest stage of the pipeline, and it’s all hands on deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranging anywhere from 1 to 4 years, production is where the game really starts to take shape. The story is refined, assets (characters, creatures, props and environments) are created, the rules of play are set, levels and worlds are built, code is written, and so much more!</p>



<h5 id="3-post-production">3. Post-production</h5>



<p>Once production is complete and the game has shipped, the game development process continues with some team members being relegated to maintenance (fixing bugs, creating patches) or creating bonus or downloadable content (DLC). Others may move onto the sequel or the next project.</p>



<p>A post-mortem or debrief may be held to discuss what worked/didn’t work and determine what could be done better next time. All the design documents, assets and code are finalized, gathered and stored, in case they are needed in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Making computer games can be a great entry point into computer science. Writing code is a major part of making video games, and 58 percent of the professionals surveyed said that programming was a key element of game development. However, they were quick to point out that the great thrill of programming for game development is to make games enjoyable for others.</p>



<p>This consideration for how others experience games is at the heart of game development, in the form of both imagining another&#8217;s experience of the game and direct feedback by users. It&#8217;s not coding just to code, it is coding to create something fun for others.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Game creation is an art of understanding and bending perception of a user&#8230; Even if it is ultimately used outside the scope of game creation.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;— Game developer</p>



<p><em>&#8220;You need to be creative, open minded to anything that comes at you. You need to think outside of reality. You also need to be determined and focused.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;— 8th grade student</p>



<p>Students indicated that coding was an enjoyable aspect of their course. Oddly, they often didn&#8217;t recognize the games they were creating were made for their classmates to play. This seems to be a key component of a game development course, as reflected by the professionals&#8217; experience in the field. Perhaps highlighting this aspect for students would add to their experience in a positive way.</p>
